My project is based on the interplay between music and dance and how it serves as powerful self-expression and exploration, creating the opportunity to connect and relate with others or yourself. Sharing and experiencing “music” can have cathartic effects and bring people together throughout time. 

Dance is a form of communication, a heightened body language, and emotional release in physical shape. It is usually accompanied by auditory effects and music.

In times of doubt, a learned footwork (culturally) or memorized song can bond/unite groups. 

As someone who is introverted, i felt like most of my "outward" expression is related to performing or music appreciation.

Ive compiled archives sheet music used for dances- photographs of dancers.
